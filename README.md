#SIT_DSA_G24
Todo:

1. change algo to A\* or yen
2. cost is dist x 0.1 (need to find pricing)
   - bigger plane more expensive? e.g. big plane cost > mid plane cost > small plane cost
     - i.e. 10,000km x big plane cost = $500
     - i.e. 10,000km x mid plane cost = $350
     - i.e. 10,000km x small plane cost = $200
3. get rid of graph intialisation page (before keying in the data)
4. documentation
5. presentation slides
