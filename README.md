Currently, code is alright.

1. Algorithms:
   Key algorithms have been applied, but ensuring you've integrated both learned and potentially new data structures beyond what's seen can enhance this to get A.
1a. Explore these:
   * Advanced Graph Algorithms: Implement algorithms like A* or Dijkstra's Algorithm with priority queues for more efficient pathfinding.
   * Data Structures: Use advanced data structures such as heaps for managing distances, or disjoint set unions for grouping airports.
   * Dynamic Programming: For multi-leg flights, consider using dynamic programming to find optimal routes considering layovers or costs.
   * Machine Learning: Integrate simple machine learning models to predict flight delays or prices, enhancing the route optimization process

2. Features:
   Current implementation covers basic functionalities. Adding error handling, direct and multi-leg flight options, and efficiency optimizations can strengthen this area
2a. Ensure our application
   * Implements all essential features flawlessly: Focus on error-free execution of core functionalities like adding, searching, and displaying flight routes.
   * User Authentication: Incorporate secure login/logout functionality for users.
   * Dynamic Data Handling: Allow users to add and modify flight data, reflecting changes in real-time.
   * Comprehensive Error Handling: Ensure the application gracefully handles user input errors and system exceptions.
   * Efficient Data Storage: Use an appropriate data storage solution for persisting flight data and user information.
   * Feedback Mechanisms: Provide clear user feedback for actions, such as successful operations or errors.

3. Creativity:
   To score highly, introduce additional innovative features beyond the basics.
3a. Ideas:
   * Real-Time Flight Updates: Integrate real-time data fetching for flight statuses, delays, and cancellations.
   * Environmental Impact Calculator: Offer a feature to calculate the carbon footprint of different flight routes.
   * Flexible Date Search: Allow users to search for flights with flexible dates to find the best rates or options.
   * Interactive Route Map: Develop an interactive map that visualizes flight paths and provides detailed information on hover or click.
   * Personalized Flight Recommendations: Implement a feature that suggests flights based on user preferences, past searches, or deals.

4. UI/Visualization:
   The current script lacks a UI/Visualization component. Developing a graphical user interface or a web-based interface would be crucial to meet this criterion
4a. Guidelines:
   * Design a professional, intuitive interface focusing on user experience. Utilize modern UI frameworks if applicable.
   * Ensure responsiveness across devices.
   * Integrate interactive elements like live-updating charts or maps for flight paths.
   * Prioritize clarity and simplicity, making navigation straightforward.
   * Incorporate feedback mechanisms, like tooltips and visual cues, for an enhanced user experience.

5. Presentation:
   While your code's structure is a start, the presentation of your project, including documentation, code clarity, and a demo, will significantly impact this score
5a. For excellent presentation:
   * Ensure all team members participate actively, demonstrating familiarity with the project.
   * Organize your content clearly, starting with an introduction, followed by a detailed explanation of features, algorithms, and creative elements.
   * Practice to maintain clarity and confidence in delivery.
   * Use visual aids effectively to illustrate key points.
   * Prepare for questions, demonstrating depth in your project understanding.
