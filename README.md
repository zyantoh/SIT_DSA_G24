Todo:

1. Algorithms:
   - Dynamic Programming:
       - for this one we probably need to come up with how to properly calculate the cost of a path
         - **currently it is: cost is dist x 0.1 (need to find pricing)**
         - bigger plane more expensive? e.g. big plane cost > mid plane cost > small plane cost
           - i.e. 10,000km x big plane cost = $500
           - i.e. 10,000km x mid plane cost = $350
           - i.e. 10,000km x small plane cost = $200

2. Feaures:

   ~~- Implement comprehensive error handling.~~
     ~~- e.g. no routes found, etc.~~
   - Feedback mechanisms
     - provide clear user feedback for actions like successful operations
       - e.g. x number of routes found, etc.

3. Creativity:
   - Environmental Impact
     - feature to calculate carbon footprint of different flight routes
   - Sort flights by Distance, Cost, or Environmental Impact
      - waiting for cost update and environmental impact update
