Currently, code is alright.

1. Algorithms:
   Key algorithms have been applied, but ensuring you've integrated both learned and potentially new data structures beyond what's seen can enhance this to get A

2. Features:
   Current implementation covers basic functionalities. Adding error handling, direct and multi-leg flight options, and efficiency optimizations can strengthen this area

3. Creativity:
   To score highly, introduce additional innovative features beyond the basics. Suggestions could include dynamic flight pricing, environmental impact estimates, or alternative route suggestions

4. UI/Visualization:
   The current script lacks a UI/Visualization component. Developing a graphical user interface or a web-based interface would be crucial to meet this criterion

5. Presentation:
   While your code's structure is a start, the presentation of your project, including documentation, code clarity, and a demo, will significantly impact this score
